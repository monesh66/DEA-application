Data Entry Automation (DEA)

Data Entry Automation (DEA) is a three-layer architecture designed to automate data entry workflows by integrating OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and machine-learning-based field mapping.

The current version focuses on OCR-driven text extraction and structured data entry, with ML-based auto-mapping planned for future releases.

🚀 Project Overview

Manual data entry from scanned documents is time-consuming and error-prone. DEA aims to streamline this process by:

Extracting text from scanned images using OCR

Allowing users to map extracted text to structured fields

Preparing the foundation for ML-based auto-mapping

Separating responsibilities across clean architectural layers
